## Introduction

All repos are [Platformio](https://platformio.org/) projects, all tested under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. 

Most of the repos will utilize multiple environments with different settings for different board revisions. Please refer to **platformio.ini** file within project folder.

For each project please find detailed description using links below

## How to flash

### Recomended: Using Platformio

All firmware files in this repo are [Platformio](https://platformio.org/) projects. This is a preferred tool to be used together with ATtiny Flasher, since it generally hadles better than our beloved Arduino IDE
- It doesn't require manual installation of new boards, it is enough to mention your board in the project configuration and Platformio will pull full framework automatically
- Same goes for the required libraries, just list your dependencies in the project config, Platformio will pull the latest versions
- It is a grown-up code editor, with the possibilities to look up for library sources and adding multiple source files to your project to create good structure.
- It allows to fine-tune build and upload settings as well as many more parameters.

To install Platformio simply add an extension to VS Code

#### Flashing Kits using Platformio

Simply open project in the Platformio IDE and run `Platformio: Build` and `Platformio: Upload` tasks. All the relevant settings can be found in `platformio.ini` file in the project folder.

#### Using Platformio to update Flasher firmware

Open [attiny-flasher](/firmware/flasher/attiny-flasher) folder in Platformio IDE. Find in the Platformio panel your revision of the board (Single letter, usually G, H, J etc is printed in the back side of the PCB). Use the physical switch on the Flasher to select self-programming mode.

Run `Upload` task.

### Using Arduino IDE

All Flasher Kits are built on ATTINY85 MCU which is not supported by default in Arduino IDE. Therefore first you need to add ATTINY85 support to your Arduino IDe using board manager. Use this link json configuration
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damellis/attiny/ide-1.6.x-boards-manager/package_damellis_attiny_index.json
```

#### Flasher Configuration

By default ATTiny Flasher would expect 115200 baudrate when programming Flasher Projects. Arduino IDE in turn uses 19200 baud rate for the same. This can be fixed by modifying Arduino IDE internal configs (which is not recomended) or by flashing Flasher with updated baud rate

After this is done you may use `Arduino as ISP` programmer in the Arduino IDE with no modifications.

### Using avrdude

If you prefer to flash Kits usging pure console, you can use `avrdude` with the proper configuration (similar to what Platformio does under the hood)

Assuming you have built `firmware.hex` and your upload port to be `/dev/ttyUSB0`
```
avrdude -P/dev/ttyUSB0 -b115200 -v -p attiny85 -c stk500v1 -b 115200 -e -D -U flash:w:firmware.hex:i
```
